This is an extension of my previous application EMBER.JS REAL TIME TWEET SEARCH ENGINE https://github.com/tarun29061990/Tweet_Search.git ..

I was not fully satisfied with my previous application so I integrated a attitude feature in it and I named it as thought search. Suppose you want to search a thought about say "robot" and you want to have these thoughts with a positive attitude like "This robot is awesome".. So in order to do this type the "robot" keyword in the textfield and assign a attitude "positive/negative/normal" and hit "GO!" and boom the result will be in front of your eyes... :)

I have coded this application in Ember.js.


Feel free to use it and take the most of it... :D :D
